## Abstract
Following Shi, Blei and Veitch (2019), I have applied the neural network called "Dragonnet" to see how well it can perform for causal inferences. In my simulation, neural network methods outperform the other methods such as linear regression and Random Forest regression in terms of both bias and RMSE. This result might imply that neural network methods can perform well for causal inferences especially when treatment and outcome depend on covariates nonlinearly. The "Dragonnet" outperforms the existing neural network method.
